# Recipes
My favourite recipes documented in LaTex
These recipes are not my own, but a collection of recipes from other people, books and magazines.
They were collected so I could learn Latex and have my recipe collection available as a PDF,
loadable from tablet and smartphone whilst cooking and shopping.
These files are not intended for publication or distribution.
