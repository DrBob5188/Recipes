\section*{Ingredients}
\begin{ingredients-list}
	\item 3 tbs coriander seeds
	\item 1 tsp cumin seeds
	\item 1 tsp fennel seeds
	\item 15 dried chillies, deseeded, soaked in hot water, drained and chopped
	\item 270g red eschallots, roughly chopped
	\item 3 cloves garlic
	\item 20g belachan, toasted* 
	\item 25g fresh turmeric root
	\item 3 tbs coconut cream
	\item 6 - 7 sprigs of curry leaves
	\item 4 tbs veg oil
	\item 1 star anise
	\item 2 whole cloves
	\item 1 cinnamon stick
	\item 1\sfrac{1}{2} kg chicken thigh fillets
	\item 300g baby chat potatoes peeled and halved
	\item 2 birds eye chillies, de-seeded and halved lengthways
	\item 400ml coconut milk
	\item 1 tbs salt
	\item 1 tsp sugar
	\item 100ml coconut cream
	\item 2 pandan leaves, shredded lengthways and knotted
\end{ingredients-list}

\section*{Directions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To begin making the curry, dry toast the coriander, cumin and fennel seeds in a frypan until fragrant and beginning to smoke
		 Tip into mortar and pestle or electric spice grinder and grind to a powder. Set aside.
	\item To make the spice paste or rempah you may do it the old fashioned and very very effective way or blitz the ingredients in a mini food processor.
		If you are using the mortar and pestle, start by pounding a small amount of the prepared, dried chillies and adding small handfuls at a time, all the while pounding thoroughly to a 			fine paste. Continue to add and pound the eschallots, garlic, belachan and turmeric in the same manner until all are a homogenous, fine paste.
		If using a mini food processor still exercise the same patience and pulverize only small amounts of the ingredients at a time, to achieve a fine paste.
	\item Heat vegetable oil in a heavy based saucepan or wok, to a medium heat. Toast star anise, cloves and cinnamon stick for about 20 seconds.
		Add spice paste and sauté for about six to ten minutes, or until the sauce is very fragrant and the oil is separating from the rempah.
		Add coconut cream, pandan leaves and curry leaves and keep cooking until very fragrant.
		You will know when the paste is ready when the oil begins to separate from the mixture and rising to the surface.
	\item Add chicken pieces and stir for one minute. Add potatoes, coconut milk, salt and sugar.
		Cover and simmer until chicken and potatoes are tender. Add coconut cream and birds eye chillies and simmer for a further five minutes.
		Serve with roti and or steamed jasmine rice.
\end{enumerate}
* Shortcut – Toast belachan in a toaster. Note: turn electricity off before retrieving your foil. Simply chop the belachan as finely as possible, scatter thinly onto a double layer foil, fold into a tidy flat parcel and press down slightly all over. Toast in a regular toaster a few times until the belachan is fragrant , dry and crumbly.
